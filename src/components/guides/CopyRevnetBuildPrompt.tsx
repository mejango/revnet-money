const REVNET_BUILD_PROMPT = `My product: [describe the users, the value they exchange, and the experience I want].

Help me design and build this product. If you are running in Claude Code, first install the Juicebox V6 skills library (https://github.com/mejango/juicebox-skills — run /plugin marketplace add mejango/juicebox-skills, then /plugin install juicebox-v6@juicebox) and use the current skills index to find its revnet deployment, economics, loans, bridging, and transaction guidance for addresses, ABIs, economics, and transaction safety. Then read https://revnet.money/learn and https://revnet.money/build, and inspect the current Revnet V6 implementation at https://github.com/rev-net/revnet-core-v6 and the Juicebox V6 contracts at https://github.com/Bananapus/version-6. Do not substitute an older protocol version.

Design the smallest product that uses a revnet for payments and shared revenue. Explain each idea before its technical name, and include a glossary. Cover the fixed schedule, tokens created per payment, recurring rate cuts, contributor shares, cash out rules, and fixed token allocations. Then explain accepted assets, networks, shop transfer rules, and what the operator can still change.

Map each user action to exact V6 reads and transactions, including payments, token issuance, cash outs, loans, buyback routing, shops, and multichain settlement where relevant. For every write, identify the contract, function, arguments, units, chain, permissions, approvals, slippage or minimum-output protection, and state that must be re-read immediately before signing. Use current V6 SDK builders, verify the deployed contracts, and encode then decode each built request to check its arguments. Ask for an explicit wallet signature only after review.`;
