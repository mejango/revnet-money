/**
 * Qualifies DATA that is shown — an approximation, a sampling caveat, a stale read. Defining a
 * TERM is `ConceptTerm`'s job, which underlines the word instead of adding a glyph beside it.
 *
 * A small icon that carries a caveat without taking a line of the layout.
 *
 * For notes that are ALWAYS true of a given project rather than notes about something being
 * wrong — a permanent banner reads as a warning and trains the reader to ignore it. Anything
 * saying data is missing or a source is down belongs inline, where it cannot be missed.
 *
 * No `title` alongside it: the browser would show its own slower copy on top of this one.
 * `aria-label` carries the text for assistive tech, and the panel opens on tap.
