 * - The operator itself (an EOA, or the Safe through its own app): a single
 *   chain keeps the simulate-first wallet write; two or more are bundled into
 *   ONE Relayr payment, so an omnichain edit costs one signature instead of N
 *   chain switches. Gas is estimated against each chain's live state first, so
 *   a call that would revert never reaches the bundle. A Safe-app connection
 *   cannot sign Relayr's forward requests, so it runs the chains one by one.
 * - A signer of an operator Safe: the exact call is simulated FROM the Safe,
 *   then proposed to that chain's Safe Transaction Service with this signer's
 *   confirmation — one proposal per chain, since each Safe queue is its own.
 *   An identical proposal already queued is confirmed rather than duplicated.
 *   The remaining signers confirm and execute from the Safe queue card here or
 *   in the Safe app.
