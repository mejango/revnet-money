// Launch guard: a project whose accounting contexts and base currency need a
// JBPrices conversion that no feed can serve is bricked at runtime — USDC pays
// revert against an ETH base (JBTerminalStore converts context.currency ->
// baseCurrency), and mixed-balance cash-outs/surplus views revert as soon as
// two contexts both hold funds (the store converts every context's balance
// into the reclaimed context's currency, not the base). Feeds resolve direct
// or inverse only — never transitively — and revnet stages can never register
// project-level feeds, so a feed-less combination must be blocked BEFORE
// launch. Probing on-chain (project 0 = the default feeds a new project falls
// through to) means a later protocol-side feed registration unblocks the
// combination with no client release.
//
// Pair derivation and the probe itself live in the SDK; only the user-facing
// copy and the fail-closed policy are local.
