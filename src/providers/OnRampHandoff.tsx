 * What we say once the purchase is handed to the on-ramp provider.
 *
 * Card purchases of crypto are declined far more often than people expect —
 * the only public study of the question put card authorisation around 43%
 * against 96% for bank transfer — and the decline arrives in the provider's
 * window with no explanation. Saying so up front, with the one lever that
 * actually helps, is cheaper than a support ticket that reads "your site is
 * broken".
 *
 * `url` is the same window we just opened: popup blockers are common enough
 * that the handoff needs a link the visitor can click themselves.
