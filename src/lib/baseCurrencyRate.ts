/**
 * PRICE-CHART AXIS — canonical semantics, shared by every webclient.
 *
 * The axis unit is the ruleset's `baseCurrency`. That is what the project denominates
 * issuance in and what the protocol itself prices against: `JBTerminalStore` converts every
 * payment into `ruleset.baseCurrency()` before applying the weight
 * (`tokenCount = amount * weight / weightRatio`, JBTerminalStore.sol:1165-1175), and
 * `JBBuybackHook` repeats the same conversion when choosing mint-vs-swap
 * (JBBuybackHook.sol:1153-1164). It is also the only unit in which the issuance line is
 * EXACT, since issuance is `1 / weight` with no feed involved.
 *
 * Series and their native units:
 *   issuance ceiling (1/weight) → already base currency per token. NO conversion.
 *   AMM / pool price           → accounting (terminal) token per project token.
 *   cash-out floor + minimum   → accounting token per project token (balance ÷ supply).
 *
 * The last two are multiplied by `basePerAccountingToken` to reach the axis.
 *
 * Two rate sources, in preference order:
 *  1. `JBPrices` — the protocol's OWN feed, the one the terminal consults on every payment.
 *     Authoritative but current-only, so it restates history when the pair actually floats.
 *  2. Pay-event ratios from the indexer — per-timestamp, so history stays history, but only
 *     usable where the indexer values the accounting token (see below).
 *
 * Historical points prefer (2) and fall back to (1). NEVER fabricate a rate: if neither
 * source has one the series is omitted and the UI says so. A missing line is honest, a
 * wrongly denominated one is not — but a line withheld while the protocol itself has the
 * rate on chain is just a gap, which is why (1) is consulted for every off-axis project.

/**
 * Is the accounting token already the axis unit?
 *
 * The axis is the ruleset's `baseCurrency` (see lib/baseCurrencyRate.ts for the full
 * contract). When the accounting token IS that currency — a token-keyed base currency, or
 * ETH against a native terminal — the AMM and cash-out series are already on-axis and no
 * rate is needed. `JBPrices.pricePerUnitOf` returns exactly 1e18 for that case too.

 * Two caveats this function enforces, both learned from live data:
