/**
 * The salt for one sucker-extension attempt, held until the attempt completes.
 *
 * `JBSuckerRegistry.deploySuckersFor` derives each sucker's address from
 * `keccak256(abi.encode(sender, salt))` (JBSuckerRegistry.sol:1043), which is what makes a
 * pair of peers land on the SAME address on both chains — the registry's own comment calls
 * this "an intentional part of the same-address peer invariant".
 *
 * An extension writes to several chains in sequence, and `runSequentialWrites` throws on the
 * first failure — including the Safe path, which always throws a pending error at the first
 * proposal. So a partial run is the NORMAL case, not an edge case. Minting a fresh salt on
 * the retry would deploy the remaining suckers at addresses the already-deployed peers can
 * never pair with, leaving orphans that bridged funds can reach but nothing can claim from.
 *
 * The salt is therefore keyed by (sender, project, target chain) and reused until the
 * attempt is finished. It is scoped to the sender because the derivation includes it: a
 * different wallet resuming the same extension must NOT reuse the salt, since its suckers
 * would land elsewhere regardless.
