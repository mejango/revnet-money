 * see the citation on each entry — because a confident wrong explanation of where money goes
 * is worse than no explanation at all.
 *
 * Written for someone who has never read a Juicebox doc. No "ruleset", no "issuance weight",
 * no "surplus", no "splits" — those are our words, not theirs. Where a word is unavoidable
 * (a "cycle" is a real thing that repeats) it gets glossed in the sentence that uses it.
